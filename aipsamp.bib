  abstract = {The object of this paper is to furnish the engineerwith a simple means of estimating the friction factors to be used in computing the loss of head in clean new pipes and in closed conduits running full with steady flow. The modern developments in the application of theoretical hydrodynamics to the fluid-friction problem are impressive and scattered through an extensive literature. This paper is not intended as a critical survey ofthis wide field. For a concise review, Professor Bakhineteff's small book on the mechanics of fluid flow is an excellent reference. Prandtl and Tietjeris and Rouse have also made notable contributions to the subject. The author does not clabn to offer anything particularly new or original, his aim merely being to embody the now accepted conclusions in convenient form for engineering use.},

These methods utilize a wide range of roughness scales, including roughness height, pitch, density, and shape parameters. Most of these scales were developed for regular roughness, limiting their applicability to predict the drag for many engineering flows. A new correlation is proposed to estimate the frictional drag for a surface covered with three-dimensional, irregular roughness in the fully rough regime. The correlation relies solely on a measurement of the surface roughness profile and builds on previous work utilizing moments of the surface statistics. A relationship is given for the equivalent sandgrain roughness height as a function of the root-mean-square roughness height and the skewness of the roughness probability density function. Boundary layer similarity scaling then allows the overall frictional drag coefficient to be determined as a function of the ratio of the equivalent sandgrain roughness height to length of the surface.}",

Also described are the numerical procedures employed to determine Λs from three-dimensional profilometry data. The sand grain roughness values determined with this approach are then compared with and verified byks magnitudes determined using: (i) analytic geometry for uniformly shaped roughness elements arranged in a regular pattern on a test surface, and (ii) measurements made with nonuniform, three-dimensional, irregular roughness with irregular geometry and arrangement. The experiments to obtain these measurements are conducted using this latter type of roughness placed on the walls of a two-dimensional channel. Skin friction coefficients are measured in this channel with three different types of rough surfaces on the top and bottom walls, and agree very well with values determined using the numerical procedures and existing correlations.

The roughness geometry is generated by randomly distributing roughness elements of random size and prescribed shape on a flat surface. The roughness generation approach allows systematic variation of moments of surface height probability density function (PDF), size distribution of roughness peaks, and surface slope. A total number of 38 cases are solved. It is understood that a correlation based on surface height skewness and effective slope (ES) can satisfactorily predict ks normalized with maximum peak-to-valley roughness height within a major part of the studied parameter space. Such a correlation is developed based on the present data points and a number of complementary data points from the literature. It is also shown that the peak size distribution can independently influence the skin friction; at fixed values of rms surface height, skewness, kurtosis, and ES, a surface with uniform size peaks causes higher skin friction compared to one with nonuniform peak sizes. Additionally, it is understood that a roughness generated by regular arrangement of roughness elements may lead to a significantly different skin friction compared to a random arrangement. A staggered and an aligned regular arrangement are examined in this paper and it is observed that the former produces significantly closer results to the corresponding random arrangement.}",

abstract = "Typical engineering rough surfaces show only limited resemblance to the artificially constructed rough surfaces that have been the basis of most previous fundamental research on turbulent flow over rough walls. In this article flow past an irregular rough surface is investigated, based on a scan of a rough graphite surface that serves as a typical example for an irregular rough surface found in engineering applications. The scanned map of surface height versus lateral coordinates is filtered in Fourier space to remove features on very small scales and to create a smoothly varying periodic representation of the surface. The surface is used as a no-slip boundary in direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow. For the resolution of the irregular boundary an iterative embedded boundary method is employed. The effects of the surface filtering on the turbulent flow are investigated by studying a series of surfaces with decreasing level of filtering. Mean flow, Reynolds stress and dispersive stress profiles show good agreement once a sufficiently large number of Fourier modes are retained. However, significant differences are observed if only the largest surface features are resolved. Strongly filtered surfaces give rise to a higher mean-flow velocity and to a higher variation of the streamwise velocity in the roughness layer compared with weakly filtered surfaces. In contrast, for the weakly filtered surfaces the mean flow is reversed over most of the lower part of the roughness sublayer and higher levels of dispersive shear stress are found."

	abstract = {Roughness only alters the near-wall region of turbulent flow and leaves the outer-layer unaffected, making it a prime candidate for the minimal-span channel framework which only captures the near-wall flow. Recently, Chung et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418-431) showed that the minimal-span channel can accurately characterise the hydraulic behaviour of roughness. Following on from this, we aim to further optimise the minimal-span channel framework by primarily noting that the outer layer it produces is inherently incorrect, and as such modifications to this region can be made to improve performance. Firstly, a half-height channel with slip wall is shown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with half the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the outer layer of a half-height channel. This reduces the high streamwise velocity associated with the minimal channel and allows for a larger computational time step. The streamwise length of the channel is also investigated independent of the previous improvements, and suggests the minimum length should be at least 3 times the spanwise width and also 1000 viscous-units long, whichever is longer. Finally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds number with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic behaviour of a rough surface, instead of running multiple simulations at fixed roughness Reynolds numbers.}

abstract = "The flow conditions at which a given surface will begin to show the effects of roughness in the form of increased wall shear stress above that of the hydraulically-smooth wall and the behavior of frictional drag in the transitionally-rough regime are still poorly understood. From a practical standpoint, the engineering correlations to predict this behavior should be based on information that can be obtained solely from the surface topography, thus excluding any information that requires hydrodynamic testing. The goal of this work is to take a systematic approach when generating surface roughness where the roughness parameters can be controlled. Three surfaces with fixed amplitude and varying power-law spectral slope (E(κ) ∼ κP; P=−0.5,−1.0,−1.5) were generated and replicated using high-resolution 3D printing. Results show that the surface with the shallower spectral slope, P=−0.5, produces the highest drag, whereas the surface with the steeper spectral slope, P=−1.5 produces the least drag. This highlights that some roughness scales do not contribute significantly to the drag. In fact, the effective slopes, ES of the investigated surfaces were less than 0.35, which indicates that the surfaces are in the so-called “wavy” regime (Schultz and Flack, 2009). A high-pass filter of 1 mm (corresponding to  ∼ 10 times of the roughness height) was applied. By removing the long-wavelength roughness scales, the correlation between the filtered roughness amplitude and the frictional drag showed the correct trend."

Independent measurements of St and cf over a wide variety of test conditions permit assessments of the variation of the Reynolds analogy factor (i.e., 2St/cf) with Reynolds number, freestream pressure gradient, surface roughness, and freestream turbulence. While the factor is fairly independent of Reynolds number, it increases with positive (adverse) pressure gradient and decreases with negative (favorable) pressure gradient. This variation can be traced directly to the governing equations for momentum and energy which dictate a more direct influence of pressure gradient on wall shear than on energy (heat) transfer. Surface roughness introduces a large pressure drag component to the net skin friction measurement without a corresponding mechanism for a comparable increase in heat transfer. Accordingly, the Reynolds analogy factor decreases dramatically with surface roughness (by as much as 50\% as roughness elements become more prominent). Freestream turbulence has the opposite effect of increasing heat transfer more than skin friction, thus the Reynolds analogy factor increases with turbulence level (by up to 35\% at a level of 11\% freestream turbulence). Physical mechanisms responsible for the observed variations are offered in each case. Finally, synergies resulting from the combinations of pressure gradient and freestream turbulence with surface roughness are evaluated. With this added insight, the Reynolds analogy remains a useful tool for qualitative assessments of complex turbine flows where both heat load management and aerodynamic efficiency are critical design parameters. }",

This chapter discusses the simple case of the turbulent boundary layer in a constant pressure field and considers the complex problem of the effects of pressure gradients, and variable wall roughness. The concepts of boundary layer phenomena, in general, and turbulent boundary layers, in particular, have found application in a wide range of fields including aeronautics, guided missiles, marine engineering, hydraulics, meteorology, oceanography, chemical engineering, atomic reactors, and the flow of liquids and gases in the human body. Many ideas for turbulent boundary layers involve assumptions other than those for turbulent shear stresses and in these cases, the validity of the results is examined first for laminar layers and then interpreted in the light of the possible shear stress patterns of turbulent layers. The effect of roughness on boundary layer characteristics is examined in the chapter. The wall is aerodynamically smooth for a turbulent boundary layer if the roughness elements are so small as to be buried in the laminar sublayer. Pressure gradients, Reynolds number, or roughness does not affect the constants of proportionality. The assumption of a constant outer viscosity has been investigated only for the case of equilibrium layers."

abstract = "Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is carried out to investigate flow and heat transfer (passive scalar) over rough surfaces extracted from microscopy of combustion chamber deposits (CCD) in a direct injection test engine. The simulation set-up is a channel with one rough and one smooth wall. The roughness characteristic height, defined as maximum peak-to-valley height averaged over several subsets of the surface, in viscous units (k+) is varied from 11 to 46 in the simulations. Based on the simulation results, it is estimated that the equivalent sand roughness size of the CCD is approximately 300 µm , which is more than two times larger than the physical height of the roughness features. It is also demonstrated that the ratio of Stanton number to friction coefficient on a rough wall is smaller than that on a smooth wall at the same Reynolds number, and it decreases with an increase in k+."
